% \textbf{Conclusion}
A high precision and versatile positioning platform has been presented.
In order to obtain nanometer precision, a Stewart platform based stabilization system (the NASS) is proposed.
A 3D finite mass model has been developed to test such stabilization system. It has been showed that even with a simple control architecture, the parasitic motions of the sample can be reduced down to \(\SI{50}{\nano\metre}\).

These type of stabilization platform associated with a precise 6 DoF metrology system could be used for many other positioning systems.

To further improve the performance of the system, many control architecture could be developed such as a hybrid feedback-feedforward control or HAC-LAC feedback control. Moreover, to address the robustness issue, control techniques such as \(\mathcal{H}_\infty\) loop-shaping and \(\mu\)-synthesis would be of great help.
